## Configuration
A configuration file won't be created for you, but the program will look for one
at the same directory where the executable _jar_ is. This file has to go by the
name of _uno.yml_. You can find a sample at the project's _resources_ directory.
Bear in mind that the available settings are somewhat limited at this point.
